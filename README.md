# Job Recommendation Service

This project is a job recommendation service that suggests relevant job postings to users based on their profiles and preferences. It is built with Flask for the backend, SQLite for the database, and Flask-Migrate for database migrations. The service includes a recommendation algorithm to match users with suitable job postings based on their skills, experience, and job preferences.

## Features
- RESTful API that accepts user profile data and returns a list of recommended job postings.
- Flexible recommendation algorithm that matches user profiles with job postings.
- Database design to store user profiles and job postings.
- Proper error handling and testing.
- Light/dark theme switch for the frontend.
